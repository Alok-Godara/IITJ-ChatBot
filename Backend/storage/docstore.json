It is one of the eight new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) established by the \nMinistry of Human Resource Development, Government of India under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011 \nwhich declares these eight IITs as well as the conversion of the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University to \nIIT.The Act was passed in the Lok Sabha on 24 March 2011[4] and by the Rajya Sabha on 30 April 2012.\n\nHistory:\nIIT Jodhpur was first announced by the Central Government in July 2007, although the formal announcement was made in 2008, with IIT Kanpur mentoring IIT Jodhpur[citation needed]. In July 2008, the first academic session of IIT Jodhpur began at the IIT Kanpur campus, with 109 undergraduate students in Computer Science Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The institute was sanctioned as an IIT for Rajasthan, and not for Jodhpur in specific. It was after considering various cities, including Ajmer, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur that the Prof. Vijay Shankar Vyas led committee suggested Jodhpur as the location for the IIT in Rajasthan. In late 2009, the MHRD granted final approval for establishing the institute at Jodhpur.\n\nA portion of the MBM Engineering College under JNV University, Jodhpur was identified as the location for the transit campus of IIT Jodhpur. In May 2010, classes of IIT Jodhpur were shifted from IIT Kanpur to the transit campus in Jodhpur. In July 2017, the academic and residential campuses of IIT Jodhpur were migrated to the permanent campus. Construction of the permanent campus is still in progress.\n\nPermanent campus:\nIITJ is located about 24 km from Jodhpur city on National Highway 65 which connects Jodhpur to Nagaur. The site spans over 852 acres (3.45 km2) of land around Jhipasni and Gharao villages. M. M. Pallam Raju, then Union Minister for Human Resources Development, laid the foundation stone on 16 April 2013.\n\nThe permanent campus is being built on a self-sustainable model, catering for its own energy and water requirements. The campus' masterplan got 'GRIHA Exemplary Performance Award' under 'Passive Architecture Design' category at the 8th GRIHA Summit held during 2\u20133 March 2017, at India Habitat Centre, New Delhi.\n\n\n\nTransit academic campus:\nUntil the first migration of IITJ to the permanent campus, IIT Jodhpur used to function from its transit campus, at the Department of Computer Science, MBM Engineering College. The transit campus is separate from the main campus of MBM Engineering College. The transit academic campus has 20 laboratories, six classrooms of 50-person capacity and four classrooms of 200-person capacity. Two of the four large classrooms have networking and video conferencing facility to facilitate video-conferencing lectures.\n\nThe academic campus' sports facilities include basketball, football, cricket, volleyball and badminton courts.\n\nTransit residential campus\nIIT Jodhpur had set up its transit residential campus at Kendranchal colony on New Pali Road, Jodhpur. Faculty and students used to reside in the transit residential campus, which had a dining facility and a health center. It has courts for outdoor and indoor sports. There was a computer center and library annexure.\n\nThe residential campus was connected to the academic campus by institute's buses which run at frequent intervals.\n\nGovernance:\nSee also: Indian Institutes of Technology \u00a7 Organisational structure\nAll IITs follow the same organization structure which has President of India as visitor at the top of the hierarchy. Directly under the president is the IIT Council. Under the IIT Council is the board of governors of each IIT. Under the board of governors is the director, who is the chief academic and executive officer of the IIT. Under the director, in the organizational structure, comes the deputy director. Under the director and the deputy director, come the deans, heads of departments, registrar.\n\nDepartments:\n\nThe Institute has organised its academic activities to be conducted through 14 Departments & Schools. The departments are:[10]\n\nSchool of Artificial Intelligence & Data Science\nSchool of Management & Entrepreneurship\nSchool of Liberal Arts (SoLA)\nBiosciences and Bioengineering\nChemical Engineering\nChemistry\nCivil and Infrastructure Engineering\nComputer Science & Engineering\nElectrical Engineering\nHumanities & Social Sciences\nMetallurgical & Materials Engineering\nMathematics\nMechanical Engineering\nPhysics\n\n\n\nAdmissions\nFor undergraduates, IIT Jodhpur offers BTech programs. Admissions to BTech programs are carried through Joint Entrance Examination, after completing 10+2 schooling.\n\nFor PG Courses, it offers MTech, MSc, MSc \u2013 MTech, MTech \u2013 PhD,MBA and PhDprograms. The eligibility criteria for MTech involves degree in BTech, B.E. or BSc (Engineering) with at least 60% marks or 6.5/10 Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) or Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). A valid GATE score is necessary for considering enrollment for MTech program. The MSc programs are administered through JAM exam with other minimum qualifying criterion in place.\n\nIndian Institute of Technology Jodhpur was ranked in 30th place among engineering colleges by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2022.\n\n\nResearch:\n\nAt IIT Jodhpur sponsored research and development programs were and are carried out in Centers of Excellence in the areas of information and communication technology, energy, and systems sciences.[15] The French government had shown its interest in helping IIT Jodhpur develop its research and academic institute. IIT Jodhpur has signed an Agreement on Academic Exchanges and MoU with Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.\n\n\nStudent life:\nCultural festivals\n\nThe annual inter-collegiate festival Ignus,[17] usually held in the month of February is a cultural and technical festival hosted by the student body. It features competitions and events involving participants from all over the country, and concerts by eminent performers.\n\nThe annual inter-collegiate sports week, Varchas is another event organized by the student body. It involves participation from a number of institutes around the country in various sports competitions including athletics, badminton, basketball, football, cricket, chess, tennis, table tennis, volleyball and Jodhpur mini-marathon.\n\nStudents are also actively involved in activities like dramatics, literary arts, stargazing, music, quizzing, and fine arts. The Entrepreneurship Cell, which supports the growth of startups involves the student community in innovation and business activities as well.\n\n\n\n\nCONNECTIVITY (HOW TO REACH):\n\nJodhpur Airport\n28 km\nJodhpur Junction Railway Station\n25 km\n\n\nNIRF Overall Rankings\t        66 (2023)\nNIRF Engineering Rankings\t30 (2023)\t\n\n\n\nINSTITUTE FEES\n\nParticulars\tAmount\nCaution Money (One Time, Refundable)\t\u20b98,000\nOne Time Fees\t\u20b93,800\nTuition Fee (per Semester)\t\u20b91,00,000\nOther fees (per Semester)\t\u20b920,000\nTotal\t\u20b91,31,800\n\n\n\nHOSTEL FEES\n\nParticulars\tAmount\nHostel Charges (per Semester)\t\u20b97,250\nMess Advance (per Semester)\t\u20b919,000\nTotal\t\u20b926,250\n\n\nFEE WAIVERS\n\n100% Tuition Fee waiver for SC/ST/PH students.\nFull remission of the Tuition Fee for General and OBC students whose family income is less than Rs.1 lakh per annum.\nRemission of 2/3rd of the Tuition Fee for General and OBC students whose family income is between Rs.1 lakh to Rs.5 lakh per annum.\n\n\nPLACEMENT STATISTICS\n\nBranch\tPlaced (%)\nBio-Engineering\t58.82%\nComputer Science and Engineering\t97.00%\nElectrical Engineering\t94.44%\nMechanical Engineering\t85.71%\nOverall\t88.85%\n\n\nMEDIAN PACKAGE OFFERED (BRANCHWISE)\n\nBranch\tMedian CTC (in LPA)\nBio-Engineering\t16.00\nComputer Science and Engineering\t22.00\nElectrical Engineering\t17.00\nMechanical Engineering\t13.00\nOverall\t16.50\n\n\nHIGHEST PACKAGE OFFERED (BRANCHWISE)\n\nBranch\tMax CTC (in LPA)\nBio-Engineering\t37.00\nComputer Science and Engineering\t53.00\nElectrical Engineering\t51.00\nMechanical Engineering\t51.00\nOverall\t53.00\n\n\nAVERAGE PACKAGE OFFERED (BRANCHWISE)\n\nBranch\tAvg CTC (in LPA)\nBio-Engineering\t                        18.00\nComputer Science and Engineering\t23.00\nElectrical Engineering\t22.00\nMechanical Engineering\t19.00\nOverall\t21.50", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6193ba72-f918-4d45-b035-85a2be2d9df4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6193ba72-f918-4d45-b035-85a2be2d9df4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6a0a76a-ef74-49e8-937e-5ca35a982c38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f6fbb9d63e36f411e4586530079dcaca660f8baf1e02f62e71aa8cb63335275"}}, "hash": "5f6fbb9d63e36f411e4586530079dcaca660f8baf1e02f62e71aa8cb63335275", "text": "Director \nProfessor Santanu Chaudhury, Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Delhi, \nhas assumed charge as Director, IIT Jodhpur, on 10 December 2018.\nProfessor Chaudhury holds B.Tech.
